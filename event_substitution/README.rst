==================
Event substitution
==================

This module allows you to define holiday calendars and employee calendars.

* The holiday calendar is in Human Resources > Configuration.
* The employee calendar is in Human Resources > Human Resources.
* The employee calendar is generated from his contract.
* When an absence of a worker is approved, send an e-mail to the worker to whom
  the request for absence is approved, to the worker who replaces him, and to
  the person responsible for the event.
